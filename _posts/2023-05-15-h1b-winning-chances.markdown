Each year, the chances of getting selected at H-1B lottery are decreasing. 

|Year|Total Eligible Registrations|Selections|Selection Rate|
|----|----------------------------|----------|--------------|
|2021|269,424                     |124,415   |46%           |
|2022|301,447                     |131,924   |43%           |
|2023|474,421                     |127,600   |26%           |
|2024|758,994                     |110,791   |14%           |

This is crazy. Based on the data above, 2021 was the only year when an applicant had a chance close to 50%. If the number of total registraions continues to grow the rate will drop more. 

Hopefully, this data convinces USCIS to take action towards making the lottery more fair for everyone. It could be increasing the quota or limiting the number of registrations for an applicant. But at the end of the day, it's just a lottery and might not mean anything to USCIS. Even if they did something, I don't think an applicant will be granted a registration just because he/she followed the rules. And by the time the USCIS decides to implement new rules, it will be late for people like me.
