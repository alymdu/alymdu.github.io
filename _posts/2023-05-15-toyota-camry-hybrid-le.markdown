I have a 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE. As of (05-03-2023) it has 23472 miles.

I bought this car new in August of 2021 from a dealership in West Virginia. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE. I traded it in to buy the Camry. I owned the Corolla for only 6-7 months. The Corolla had many issues and it was getting harder and harder to try to fix all the problems.

So far, my Camry has been a good car. I took it for two cross country trips. About to do a third one later. First one was from Morgantown, WV to Seattle, WA. The second trip was from Seattle, WA to Irvine, CA.
